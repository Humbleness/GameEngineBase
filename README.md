# GameEngineBase
Base for game engine written from basically scratch in C++ using OpenGL and GLUT

This is the game engine I'm working on that will soon hold the dozens of triple-A releases coming over the next few years.  Currently is still pretty shitty since this is the first thing of any scale I've worked on besides random Garry's Mod commisions and stuff like that, but ya know, I like working on it


Oh yea, and thank you to the sexy individuals who made the libraries that make this thing possible

-Boost (smart pointers)

-SOIL (lightweight image loader)
and of course

-OpenGL (Open source graphics library)

-GLUT (makes OpenGL portable)
